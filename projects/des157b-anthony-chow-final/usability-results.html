        <h1>Test 1: Evelyn</h1>
        <h2>1. Was there any point where you were confused?</h2>
        <p>When trying to find their own card, it was a bit confusing that it wasn't just added to the top. Prompt was a little confusing (within 5 years, or at 5 years?).</p>

        <h2>2. Did the interface make sense when completing the tasks?</h2>
        <p>Didn't really know that the cards were clickable at first. Liked how the prompt was typed out and drew her attention there first. Consistency in closing the popups. </p>

        <h2>3. Did you have any difficulty finding the information you were looking for?</h2>
        <p>Difficulty finding their own card. Didn't realize they're ordered by age.
        </p>

        <h1>Test 2: Ama</h1>
        <h2>1. Was there any point where you were confused?</h2>
        <p>After submistting response, she expected hers to be at the top</p>

        <h2>2. Did the interface make sense when completing the tasks?</h2>
        <p>Everything seemed to make sense to her.</p>

        <h2>3. Did you have any difficulty finding the information you were looking for?</h2>
        <p>Just with finding her response. She ended up finding her response later though.</p>

        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>1. I learned that people usually expect to see their response up at the top once they've submitted theirs</p>
        <p>2. I learned that most people are viewing in a smaller display size so I should focus my designs accordingly</p>
        <p>3. Most people seemed to enjoy the interface otherwise and had no other complaits or comments</p>

        <h1>Future Updates</h1>
        <p>Based on this feedback, I hope to include some more obvious indications of interaction for cards and figure out a way so that users can see their response as soon as they submit. I also want to include more breakpoints and try to make the two-column
            card layout on smaller displays. </p>
