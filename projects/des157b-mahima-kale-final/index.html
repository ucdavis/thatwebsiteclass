            <p>        
              <i>The Book of Genesis</i> records an instance of Noah cursing his son Ham's descendants to be slaves. Although there is no biblical evidence that Ham was the "father" of African peoples, various Jewish, Christian and Islamic writers came to believe that he was, and their association helped to justify centuries of African enslavement.   
              </p>
            <br>
            <p>Medieval curse theorist (Ham theory) laid the foundation for segregationist ideas and racist ideas of black genetic inferiority.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">What aspect of religion plays a role in race or racist idea today? </p>

          <li id="460">
    
            <h1>460-375 BCE</h1>
            <p>Hippocrates’s book <i>On Airs, Waters and Places</i> is considered to be the source document of climate-based theories of racial differences. In this treatise, Hippocrates describes the effects of different environments, diets, and customs on human disposition, including physical and moral susceptibilities to disease and humors. These differences are epitomized by European peoples, whom Hippocrates characterizes as ungovernable yet courageous as a result of their cold climate, and Asian peoples, who are characterized as peaceful but timid due to their hot climate.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="question">How does climate theory reflect a racist idea?</p>

            <p>Aristotle believed humanity is divided between two - Greeks and the barbarians OR the masters and the slaves.

              <p>He said, "For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule."</p>

            <p>Arab Muslims conquered parts of North Africa, Portugal and Spain in the 7th century. Christians and Muslims battled for centuries over Mediterranean supremacy. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">How has the need for power affected the construct of race?</p>

            <h1>1300</h1>
            <p>Ghana, Mali and Sanhai, were major trade spots in the 14th century. They were large empires that invited attention.
              Ibn Batuta (Berber Maghrebi scholar and explorer who travelled extensively in the lands of Afro-Eurasia, largely in the lands of Dar al-Islam, travelling more than any other explorer in pre-modern history) emphasized that there was nothing to fear about violence in Africa.
                An audit in the Islamic Empire in Morocco , Ibn Batuta's
                travels threatened Moroccon authorities credibility in depicting foreigners as violent. Authorities whisper that Batuta is a liar to endanger his credibility. 
                
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Again, how has politics and power affected the construct of race and how cultures are defined? </p>

            <h1>1377</h1>
            <p>
              In 1377, Ibn Khaldun’s <i>Muqaddimah</i>, a "universal" history of the Arabs and Berbers, painted a different picture of foreigners. According to Khaldun, “Sub Saharan Africans [were] submissive to slavery.” At this point, Muslim powers were trading both Africans and Slavic peoples (European ethnolinguistic group) as slaves, yet Khadun’s assimilationist theory helped shift the slave trade toward Africans alone. Khaldun also suggested Hippocrates' climate theory again. He stresses that Africans who migrated to the cooler north were found to produce offsprings who have lighter skin. 

</p>
               <br>
            <p class="question">Are any of these assimilationist ideas present in our society today?</p>
          </li>
          <li id="1399">
    
            <h1>1399</h1>
            <p> Khaldun helped bolster the foundation of assimilationist ideas that largely shifted slave trade towards Africans only. However, Khaldun stood strongly against the curse of Ham.             </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">What makes Khaldun’s assimilationist ideas this a racist?</p>
          </li>
          <li id="1440">
    
            <h1>1440</h1>
            <p>The Portuguese were also selling Slavic people in large numbers; this is why the word “slave” is actually taken from “Slav.” Yet by the mid 1400s, the trading of Slavic people gave way to that of Africans, and “Western Europeans began to see the natural Slav(e) not as White, but Black.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">Why do you think there is an association of the color black meaning bad and white meaning good?</p>
          </li>
          <li id="1452">
    
            <h1>1453</h1>
            <p>King Afonso V, King of Portugal at the time, commissioned Gomes Eanes de Zurara, to write about Prince Henry’s life and work. Gomes Eanes de Zurara is credited with writing the first “recorded history of anti-Black racist ideas...” with The <i>Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of Guinea</i>, in 1453. It was a record of the Portuguese slave trade in the 1440s under Prince Henry. As the author Dr Ibram X Kendi points out, his words were “a product of, not a producer of, Prince Henry’s racist policies.

            <h1>1636</h1>
            <p>New England’s first constitution in 1636 legalized the enslavement of captives in just wars. Barbados announced that Africans and Indians that come here to be sold should serve for life unless the contract says otherwise. First generation Puritans began rationalizing the enslavement of Africans. Puritan, biblical, scientific, and Aristotle’s beliefs of hierarchy were engraved at the beginning of what became present day America.
